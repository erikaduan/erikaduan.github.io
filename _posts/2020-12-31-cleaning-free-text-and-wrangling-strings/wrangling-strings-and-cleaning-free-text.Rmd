# Introduction   

Comment fields sit somewhere in between tidy tabular data entries and large text files (i.e. documents) in terms of wrangling effort. They require human naunce to decode and the quality and completeness of comments vary between individual entries.     

This makes it hard to gauge whether cleaning comment fields is a worthwhile endeavour (especially when you have multiple other data sources that need examining). Luckily, some knowledge of string manipulations and regular expressions can help simplify this process.        

Let's get started.   

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}  
#-----load required packages-----  
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(here,  
               tidyverse,  
               microbenchmark) 
```


# Create a test dataset   

Let's imagine that my local chocolate company, [Haighs Chocolates](https://www.haighschocolates.com.au), wants to understand what food critics versus Haighs fans think about their newest product. They send out a bag of free samples with a link to an online survey that asks individuals to rate their chocolates (on a scale of 1 to 10) and provide additional comments.    

**Note:** The code used to create this survey can be accessed from my github repository [here](https://github.com/erikaduan/R-tips/tree/master/03_blog_posts/2020-05-16_untangling-strings).      

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#-----create a test dataset-----
survey_list <- list(
  expert_1 = c(8, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> &lt;Grade A beans.&gt; Easily melts. Smooth chocolate shell, with a crunchy malty filling, and not so sweet <p> I enjoyed this. </textarea>'), 
  
  expert_2 = c(7, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> &lt;Grade A beans with subtle caramel hints.&gt; Melts well. Smooth exterior. Glossy coating. Malt-filled core may be too sweet for some. </textarea>'),  
  
  expert_3 = c(8, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> &lt;Grade a beans.&gt; <p> Caramel and vanilla undertones complement the bitter dark chocolate - low sugar content and smooth chocolate shell. <p> Recommended. </textarea>'),  
  expert_4 = c(10, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> &lt;Grade A cocoa beans.&gt; Melts easily. Smooth dark chocolate contrasts nicely against the crunchy malty filling. </textarea>'),  
  
  expert_5 = c(7, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> &lt;Grade A beans,&gt; likely of Ecuador origin. Smooth dark chocolate coating. Malt filling ratio could be decreased. Easy to eat. </textarea>'),  
  
  fan_1 = c(9, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> Delicious and melts in your mouth. The malt crunch is a nice touch <p> Would recommend. </textarea>'),  
  
  fan_2 = c(10, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> Smooth dark chocolate shell likely made from grade A beans. Has some nice crunch. <p> This is definiely one of my new favourites! </textarea>'),  
  
  fan_3 = c(8, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> Tastes great. Smooth and tasty chocolate. <p> Recommended. </textarea>'),  
  
  fan_4 = c(10, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> This will be one of my new favourites. Love the malty interior! </textarea>'),  
  
  fan_5 = c(9, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> Haighs has a history of using the best (grade A) beans. Love the caramel undertones. </textarea>'),  
  
  fan_6 = c(9, '<textarea name="comment" form="1"> Delicious :)!!! </textarea>')
)  

survey <- survey_list %>% 
  map_df(~ as_tibble(t(.))) # transpose list and convert into data frame  

survey <- survey %>%
  mutate(respondee = names(survey_list)) %>%
  rename("rating" = "V1",
         "comment_field" = "V2") %>%
  select(respondee, everything()) # reorder respondee as first column  
```

```{r, results = 'markup'}
#-----examine the first few rows of data-----  
survey %>%
  head(6)  
```

Oh dear, it looks like we will first need to use regular expressions to remove all the html tags embedded within `survey$comment_field`.       


# Introduction to regular expressions       

Regular expressions, or regex, can be thought of as a separate syntax for handling patterns in strings. In R, regular expressions can be directly enclosed inside quotes like character strings or explicitly referenced inside `regex()`. For convenience, I prefer the former approach but the latter approach can help increase code readability.                  

```{r}
#-----call regular expressions in R-----
many_apples <- c("Apple", "apple", "APPLE", "apples")

str_extract(many_apples, 
            "apples?")  
#> [1] NA       "apple"  NA       "apples"

#-----call regular expressions in R using regex()-----
# regex() provides additional arguments

str_extract(many_apples, 
            regex("apples?", ignore_case = T))  
#> [1] "Apple"  "apple"  "APPLE"  "apples"

# regex() also allows comments to improve regex readability  

str_extract(many_apples, 
            regex("
                  apple  # contains the word apple
                  s?  # contains zero or one of the letter s
                  " , comments = T))
#> [1] NA       "apple"  NA       "apples"  
```


## Match characters   

Some sequences of characters have specific meanings. For example, `s` refers to the letter `"s"` but `\s` refers to any type of white space. To call whitespace in R, a second backslash `\` is required to escape special character behaviour i.e. `\\s`.          

```{r}
#-----examples of special character sequences-----  
words_and_spaces <- c(" a cat",
                      "acat",
                      "a   cat",
                      "a\ncat",
                      "a\\ncat")

# "a\\s+cat" calls variations of a...cat separated by one or more whitespaces 
# note that the string "a\ncat" also counts because \n refers to a new line

str_extract(words_and_spaces, "a\\s+cat")  
#> [1] "a cat"   NA        "a   cat" "a\ncat"  NA      

# "\\S+" refers to everything that is not white space (starting from left to right)  

str_extract(words_and_spaces, "\\S+")  
#> [1] "a"       "acat"    "a"       "a"       "a\\ncat"
```

**Note:** The special characters `\s` versus `\S` allow the extraction of opposite pattern types. In another example, lowercase `\w` refers to any word character whilst uppercase `\W` and lowercase `[^\w]` both refer to anything that is not a word character.       


## Character anchors   

I feel that the goal of writing good regex is to be as specific as possible. This is why character anchors are useful (i.e. using `^` and `$` to denote the start and end of your string respectively).       

If we revisit the example above, we can see that the presence or absence of character anchors produces very different outputs.        

```{r}
#-----impact of character anchors-----    
words_and_spaces <- c(" a cat",
                      "acat",
                      "a   cat",
                      "a\ncat",
                      "a\\ncat")

# "\\S+" refers to everything that is not white space (from left to right unless specified)  

str_extract(words_and_spaces, "\\S+")  
#> [1] "a"       "acat"    "a"       "a"       "a\\ncat"  

str_extract(words_and_spaces, "^\\S+")  
#> [1] NA       "acat"    "a"       "a"       "a\\ncat"   

str_extract(words_and_spaces, "\\S+$") 
#> [1] "cat"     "acat"    "cat"     "cat"     "a\\ncat"       
```


## Character classes and groupings   

Character classes and groupings are handy for extracting specific letter and/or digit combinations. Some special characters found inside character classes and groupings are:       

+ The operation `or` is represented by `|` i.e `[a|c]`     
+ The operation `range` is represented by `-` i.e. `[a-z]`    
+ The operation `excludes` is represented by `^` i.e. `[^a-c]`    

**Note:** Representation of a single character is denoted by `[]` and representation of a grouping i.e. combination of characters is denoted by `()`.     

```{r}
#-----extract patterns using character classes i.e. []-----    
strange_fruits <- c("apple1",
                    "bapple2",
                    "capple3",
                    "dapple4",
                    "epple5",
                    "aggle0")

str_extract(strange_fruits, "[a-d]")
#> [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" NA  "a"  

str_extract(strange_fruits, "[a-d][^p]")
#> [1] NA   "ba" "ca" "da" NA   "ag"   

# [a-d][^p] refers to one character between a and d followed by one character that is not p  

str_extract(strange_fruits, "[0|4-9]")
#> [1] NA  NA  NA  "4" "5" "0"   

# [0|4-9] refers to one number that is zero or a number from 4 to 9    
```

```{r}
#-----extract character using groupings i.e. ()-----     
strange_fruits <- c("apple1",
                    "bapple2",
                    "capple3",
                    "dapple4",
                    "epple5",
                    "aggle1")  

str_extract(strange_fruits, "a(pp|gg)le")
#> [1] "apple" "apple" "apple" "apple" NA      "aggle"    

# groups can be referenced by their order of appearance i.e. \\1 = first group  

str_extract(strange_fruits, "(a)(p|g)\\2")
#> [1] "app" "app" "app" "app" NA    "agg"   

# (a) is group 1 and can be called using \\1    
# (p|g) is group 2 and can be called using \\2     
```


## Greedy versus lazy matches   

In R, regular expression parsing is non-greedy by default. This means that we need to add quantifiers `*` and `+` to greedily extract zero or more and one or more characters respectively.      

In contrast, using a non-greedy match allows you to extract just the first characters before a white space or punctuation mark. This is useful for trimming strings or extracting file or object names. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup' , fig.align = 'center', out.width = '90%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/2020-12-31_greedy-matches.jpg")    
```

```{r}
#-----use cases for greedy matches-----   
messy_dates <- c("Thursday 24th May",
                 "Thursday  24th May  ",
                 " May",
                 "May    ")

str_extract(messy_dates, "^\\w")      
#> [1] "T" "T" NA  "M"   

# greedily extract the first word in the string    

str_extract(messy_dates, "^\\w+")   
#> [1] "Thursday" "Thursday" NA      "May"   

str_extract(messy_dates, "^\\w{1,}") # the quantifier + and {1,} are equivalent    
#> [1] "Thursday" "Thursday" NA      "May"    

str_extract(messy_dates, "^(\\S+)")  
#> [1] "Thursday" "Thursday" NA      "May"    

#-----use cases for non-greedy matches----- 
str_replace_all(messy_dates, "\\s" , "-") # replaces each individual whitespace
#> [1] "Thursday-24th-May"    "Thursday--24th-May--" "-May"                  "May----"       

str_replace_all(messy_dates, "\\s{1,2}" , "-") 
#> [1] "Thursday-24th-May"  "Thursday-24th-May-" "-May"                "May--"         

# use look arounds (next topic) to replace the whitespace(s) after the first word     

str_replace_all(messy_dates, "(?<=^\\w{1,100})\\s{1,2}" , "-") 
#> [1] "Thursday-24th May"   "Thursday-24th May  " " May"                 "May-  "     
```

**Note:** For further details explaining the regex syntax for the last example, read [this stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52431841/how-to-find-the-first-space-in-a-sentence-with-regular-expressions-within-r).       


## Look arounds    

Look around operations are useful when you are unsure of the pattern itself, but you know exactly what its preceding or following pattern is. I've found that the clearest explanation of look around operations comes from the [RStudio cheetsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf) on `string_r`, as depicted below.           

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup', fig.align = 'center', out.width = '90%', fig.cap = 'Taken from the RStudio stringr cheatsheet'} 
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/2020-12-31_look-arounds.jpg")    
```

```{r}
#-----use cases for different types of look arounds-----  
recipes <- c("crossiant recipes",
             "apple pie recipe",
             "chocolate cake  recipe", # extra space
             "cookie receipe",  # deliberate typo
             "secret KFC-recipe", 
             "very secret  McDonalds soft-serve recipe") # extra space  

# use positive look-ahead (?=...) to extract the preceding word

str_extract(recipes, "\\S+(?=\\s*recipes?)")   
#> [1] "crossiant"  "pie"        "cake"       NA           "KFC-"       "soft-serve"   

# use positive look-behind (?<=) on "secret" to identify the secret recipes  

str_extract(recipes, "(?<=secret\\s{1,10})\\S+.+")   
#> [1] NA                            NA                            NA                           
#> [4] NA                            "KFC-recipe"                  "McDonalds soft-serve recipe"   
```

**Note:** Positive look-behinds require defined boundary specifications i.e. the operation `+` needs to be converted into `{1,1000}`.       


# Improve comment field readability   

With regex revised, let us return to our Haighs chocolate survey. The first thing we can see is that html tags have been retained inside the comment field and that this field is very long (i.e. difficult to read).   

We can improve the readability of the survey by:  

+ Removing all html tags using regex.    
+ Separating phrases into columns using [`separate()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html).     

```{r, results = 'markup'}
#-----re-examine survey data-----
survey %>%
  head(5)   

#-----remove html tags-----
remove_html_tags <- regex("
                          <  # starts with <
                          [^>]+  # contains one or more of all characters excepting > 
                          >  # ends with >
                          ", comments = T)

remove_more_html <- regex("
                          \\& # starts with &
                          \\w+ # contains one or more word characters
                          \\; # ends with ;
                          ", comments = T) 

survey <- survey %>%
  mutate(comment_field = str_replace_all(comment_field, remove_html_tags, ""),
         comment_field = str_replace_all(comment_field, remove_more_html, ""))

#-----examine comment field-----  
survey %>%
  select(comment_field) %>%
  head(5) 
```

We can then split the single long comment field into multiple smaller columns. ^[Many R functions require R regex classes to be wrapped in a second set of `[ ]`, e.g. `[[:punct:]]`.]             

```{r}
#-----separate comment field into an unknown number of columns-----    
nmax <- max(str_count(survey$comment_field, "[[:punct:]]|and|with|against")) + 1

survey <- survey %>%   
  separate(comment_field,
           into = paste0("Field", seq_len(nmax)),
           sep = "[[:punct:]]|and|with|against", # separate on punctuation or conjunctions  
           remove = F,
           extra = "warn",
           fill = "right") 

#-----examine comment fields-----  
survey %>%
  select(starts_with("Field")) %>%
  head(5) 
```
 

# Manually extract topics of interest        

After separating the comment field into smaller fields, we see references to:  

+ cocoa bean grade  
+ presence of caramel or vanilla flavour     
+ chocolate smoothness    
+ how well the chocolate melts   
+ sugar content/ sweetness level  
+ malt filling   
+ chocolate coating     

Information about cocoa bean grade is highly structured. This means that extracting the letter following the word "Grade" is sufficient. A similar logic can be applied to extract whether caramel or vanilla flavour or chocolate smoothness was mentioned.          

```{r}
#----extract information about cocoa bean grade, flavour and smoothness----
tidy_survey <- survey %>%
  select(respondee,
         comment_field) %>% 
  mutate(cocoa_grade = str_extract(comment_field, "(?<=[G|g]rade\\s{0,10})[A-C|a-c]"),
         is_caramel = case_when(str_detect(comment_field, "[C|c]aramel") ~ "yes",
                                TRUE ~ "NA"), 
         is_vanilla = case_when(str_detect(comment_field, "[V|v]anilla") ~ "yes",
                                TRUE ~ "NA"),
         is_smooth = case_when(str_detect(comment_field, "[S|s]mooth") ~ "yes",
                               TRUE ~ "NA")) 

# we cannot assign TRUE ~ NA inside case_when  

tidy_survey <- tidy_survey %>%
  mutate_at(vars(cocoa_grade), ~ replace_na(., "NA"))

# replace NA in cocoa_grade with the character "NA" for consistency  
```

For more descriptive fields such as whether the chocolate melts, I find it easier to first extract a matrix of fields.         

```{r} 
#----extract information about chocolate texture----
melt_matrix <- survey %>%
  select_at(vars(respondee,
                 starts_with("Field"))) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("Field")),
            ~ replace(.x, !(str_detect(.x, ".*\\b[M|m]elt.*\\b.*")), NA)) 

# convert fields which do not contain "melt" into NA and unite all fields     

melt_cols <- str_which(colnames(melt_matrix), "^Field.+")

melt_status <- melt_matrix %>%
  unite("is_melty", # new column 
        all_of(melt_cols), # unite these columns  
        sep = "",
        remove = T,
        na.rm = T) # make sure to remove NAs  

#----convert responses into factors and recode factor levels----  
melt_status$is_melty <- factor(melt_status$is_melty)

levels(melt_status$is_melty) 
#> [1] ""                     " Easily melts"        " Melts easily"        " melts in your mouth" " Melts well"         

melt_status <- melt_status %>%
  mutate(is_melty = fct_collapse(is_melty,
                                 "yes" = c(" Easily melts",
                                           " Melts well",
                                           " Melts easily",
                                           " melts in your mouth"),
                                 "NA" = ""))

#----left join tidy_survey to melt_status----  
tidy_survey <- tidy_survey %>%
  left_join(melt_status,
            by = "respondee")
```

This process is repeated for chocolate sweetness. ^[As a repetitive step within the workflow, we might want to rewrite the generic part of this cleaning step as a function stored in a separate R script for maximal readability.]      

```{r}
#----extract information about chocolate sweetness----  
sweetness_matrix <- survey %>%
  select_at(vars(respondee,
                 starts_with("Field"))) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("Field")),
            ~ replace(.x, !(str_detect(.x, ".*\\b[S|s](weet)|(ugar).*\\b.*")), NA)) 

# convert fields which do not contain "sweet" or "sugar" into NA and unite all fields     

sweetness_cols <- str_which(colnames(sweetness_matrix), "^Field.+")

sweetness_status <- sweetness_matrix %>%
  unite("is_sweet", 
        all_of(sweetness_cols), 
        sep = "",
        remove = T,
        na.rm = T) # make sure to remove NAs  

#----convert responses into factors and recode factor levels---- 
sweetness_status$is_sweet <- factor(sweetness_status$is_sweet)

levels(sweetness_status$is_sweet)
#> [1] ""                                      " low sugar content "                   " not so sweet  I enjoyed this"        
#> [4] "filled core may be too sweet for some"

sweetness_status <- sweetness_status %>%
  mutate(is_sweet = fct_collapse(is_sweet,
                                 "yes" = c("filled core may be too sweet for some"),
                                 "no" = c(" low sugar content ",
                                          " not so sweet  I enjoyed this"),
                                 "NA" = ""))

#----left join tidy_survey to melt_status----  
tidy_survey <- tidy_survey %>%
  left_join(sweetness_status,
            by = "respondee")
```

**Note:** This method of converting topics into tabular variables works well when we are not dealing with too many factors (i.e. when recoding factors is not too cumbersome).    


# Extract a machine learning friendly dataset    

A reason why we might be interested in converting unstructured comment fields into structured variables is to generate data features for machine learning. For instance, we might be interested in whether there is a relationship between survey topics, whether the comment comes from a critic or chocolate fan, and the chocolate rating.        

```{r}
#----create final tidy_survey----

# Differences between base R and `stringr` functions      

In R, string manipulation can be performed using either base R functions or functions from the `stringr` library. A key difference between base R and `stringr` functions is the order that the string and pattern are specified. The pattern, not the string, is specified first inside base R functions, which is not a pipe friendly argument order.            

```{r}
#-----use cases for grep()-----  
desserts <- c("chocolate",
              "chocolate cake",
              "chocolate tart",
              "chocolate icecream",
              "chocolate cookies",
              "dark chocolate fudge", 
              "fruit",
              "fruit tart",
              "fruit sorbet")

grep(".*\\bchocolate\\b.*", desserts, value = F) # default is value = FALSE
#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6  

# grep, value = FALSE only extracts the position of matching elements in the vector  

str_which(desserts, ".*\\bchocolate\\b.*")  
#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6  

grep(".*\\bchocolate\\b.*", desserts, value = T) 
#> [1] "chocolate"            "chocolate cake"       "chocolate tart"       "chocolate icecream"  
#> [5] "chocolate cookies"    "dark chocolate fudge"   

# grep, value = TRUE extracts the matching elements in the vector  

str_subset(desserts, ".*\\bchocolate\\b.*") 
#> [1] "chocolate"            "chocolate cake"       "chocolate tart"       "chocolate icecream"  
#> [5] "chocolate cookies"    "dark chocolate fudge"  

# str_subset() is a wrapper around x[str_detect(x, pattern)]   
```

```{r}
#-----use cases for grepl()-----  
desserts <- c("chocolate",
              "chocolate cake",
              "chocolate tart",
              "chocolate icecream",
              "chocolate cookies",
              "dark chocolate fudge", 
              "fruit",
              "fruit tart",
              "fruit sorbet")

grepl(".*\\bchocolate\\b.*", desserts) 
#> [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE

#> [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE 

desserts[str_detect(desserts, ".*\\bchocolate\\b.*")]
#> [1] "chocolate"            "chocolate cake"       "chocolate tart"       "chocolate icecream"   "chocolate cookies"    "dark chocolate fudge"  
```

```{r}
#-----use cases for gsub()-----

              "chocolate cookies",

              "fruit",
              "fruit tart",
              "fruit sorbet")

gsub("(dark )?chocolate", "vanilla", desserts) 
#> [1] "vanilla"          "vanilla cake"     "vanilla tart"     "vanilla icecream" "vanilla cookies"  "vanilla fudge"    "fruit"           
#> [8] "fruit tart"       "fruit sorbet"    

str_replace_all(desserts, "(dark )?chocolate", "vanilla") 
#> [1] "vanilla"          "vanilla cake"     "vanilla tart"     "vanilla icecream" "vanilla cookies"  "vanilla fudge"    "fruit"           
#> [8] "fruit tart"       "fruit sorbet"            
```

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
baser_vs_stringr <- microbenchmark(grep = grep(".*\\bchocolate\\b.*", desserts, value = F),
                                   str_which = str_which(desserts, ".*\\bchocolate\\b.*"),
                                   gsub = gsub("chocolate", "vanilla", desserts),
                                   str_replace_all = str_replace_all(desserts, "chocolate", "vanilla"),
                                   grepl = grepl(".*\\bchocolate\\b.*", desserts),
                                   str_detect = str_detect(desserts, ".*\\bchocolate\\b.*"),  
                                   times = 1000)

autoplot(baser_vs_stringr)  
```

**Note:** Base R functions are significantly faster than their `stringr` equivalents.
