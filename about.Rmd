## Background     

I trained as a research scientist in respiratory immunology (PhD, UniMelb). During my post-doctoral research, I learnt R programming and applied statistical and machine learning workflows to discover how the human body orchestrates complex defensive processes against respiratory virus invasion.   

I now work (and enjoy working) in the public sector as a data scientist.         


## Education       

+ **2009-2014:** PhD - University of Melbourne    
+ **2008:** Bachelor of Science (Honours) - University of Melbourne     
+ **2005-2007:** Bachelor of Biomedical Science - University of Melbourne     


## Interests     

+ Machine learning algorithmic weaknesses (when human learning is advisable)       
+ Machine learning explanability      
+ Machine learning ethical frameworks     
+ Open government data initiatives        
+ Improving data science career pathway accessibility      
+ STEM outreach initiatives     


## Public projects    

+ [**Introduction to Python workshop materials**](https://github.com/erikaduan/Introduction-to-Python)   
A repository of beginner-friendly Python tutorials compiled from the Research Platform Services Python workshops (UniMelb, 2019) and the DIPA Introduction to Python workshop (Data61, 2020). Each tutorial exists as a self-contained Jupyter notebook and some tutorials make use of public data sources.              

+ [**Introductory mathematics in R and Python**](https://github.com/erikaduan/Introductory-maths-in-R-and-Python)     
A respository of introductory mathematics notes for beginners who are keen to understand how machine learning algorithms work but find the mathematical notations and concepts confusing (don't worry - they really are just confusing).
